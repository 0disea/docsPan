description: "Learn how to authenticate requests to the Pan API using API keys"
---

All requests to the Pan API must be authenticated using an API key. Your API key identifies your account and determines your usage limits based on your subscription plan.

## Getting your API key

1. Sign up or log in to [app.pan.dev](https://app.pan.dev)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **API Keys**
3. Click **Generate new API key**
4. Copy and securely store your API key

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Never share them publicly, commit them to version control, or include them in client-side code.
</Warning>

## Using your API key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request using the Bearer token format:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets/user_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch('https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets/user_123', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.PAN_API_KEY}`
  }
});
```

```python Python
import requests
import os

response = requests.get(
    'https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets/user_123',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.getenv('PAN_API_KEY')}"
    }
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Security best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Environment variables">
    Store your API key in environment variables or a secrets management service. Never hardcode it in your application:
    
    ```bash
    # .env file
    PAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
    
    ```javascript
    // ✅ Good
    const apiKey = process.env.PAN_API_KEY;
    
    // ❌ Bad
    const apiKey = 'sk_live_abc123...';
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Key rotation">
    Rotate your API keys periodically as part of your security strategy. If you suspect a key has been compromised:
    
    1. Revoke the compromised key immediately
    2. Generate a new API key
    3. Update your application with the new key
    4. Monitor for suspicious activity
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Scope and permissions">
    API keys are scoped to your account. Each key has access to all resources (wallets, intents) that belong to your account. Always use the principle of least privilege when creating integrations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="HTTPS only">
    Always make requests over HTTPS. The Pan API only accepts encrypted connections and will reject HTTP requests. This protects both your API key and sensitive user data in transit.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Authentication errors

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

<ResponseExample>
```json 401 Unauthorized
{
  "error": "UNAUTHORIZED",
  "message": "Invalid or missing API key"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

Common authentication issues:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Invalid API key">
    **Problem**: The API key format is incorrect or the key doesn't exist.
    
    **Solution**: Verify your API key in the dashboard and ensure you're using the Bearer token format correctly.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Missing header">
    **Problem**: The `Authorization` header is missing from the request.
    
    **Solution**: Ensure all requests include the header: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Inactive account">
    **Problem**: Your account has been suspended or deactivated.
    
    **Solution**: Check your account status in the dashboard or contact support.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data isolation

The Pan API implements strict data isolation between accounts. Each API key can only access resources (wallets, intents) that belong to the account associated with that key. Even if you know the ID of a resource from another account, you cannot access it.

This isolation is enforced at multiple levels of our architecture, ensuring privacy and security of user data.

<Info>
  **Multiple API keys**: You can create multiple API keys for the same account. This is useful for separating environments (development, staging, production) or creating keys for different services.
</Info>

## Rate limits

Authentication also determines your rate limits. Different subscription plans have different rate limits:

- **Free**: 100 requests/minute
- **Pro**: 1,000 requests/minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. See [Rate limiting](/guides/best-practices/performance#rate-limiting) for more details.
