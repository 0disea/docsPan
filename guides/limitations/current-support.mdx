### Current restrictions

<Warning>
  ❌ **No mainnet**: Only testnet support currently
  ❌ **Limited tokens**: Only predefined tokens are supported
  ❌ **Single intent type**: Only lending intents are available
  ❌ **No webhooks**: Must poll for status updates
  ❌ **Limited chains**: Only 3 testnets supported
</Warning>

## Migration path

When mainnet launches, we'll provide:

- Migration guides for moving from testnet to mainnet
- Tools to help transition wallet addresses
- Support for transferring testnet data

<Note>
  **No automatic migration**: Testnet wallets and intents will not automatically migrate to mainnet. You'll need to create new wallets and operations on mainnet.
</Note>
