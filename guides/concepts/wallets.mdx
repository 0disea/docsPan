Wallets in Pan are multi-chain entities that can hold assets simultaneously across multiple blockchains. Unlike traditional wallets that require separate addresses for each blockchain, Pan wallets use a single address that works across all supported chains.

## What is a Pan wallet?

A Pan wallet is a unified interface for managing digital assets across multiple blockchains. When you create a wallet, Pan generates a single address that's compatible with all supported blockchains, eliminating the need to manage multiple addresses.

## Creating wallets

Wallets are created via the API and associated with a unique user identifier in your application:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "user_123",
    "metadata": {
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const wallet = await createWallet({
  userId: 'user_123',
  metadata: {
    email: 'user@example.com',
    name: 'John Doe'
  }
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<ResponseExample>
```json Wallet created
{
  "id": "wallet_abc123",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
  "chains": [
    "ethereum-sepolia",
    "base-sepolia",
    "arbitrum-sepolia"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Wallet properties

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ID">
    Each wallet has a unique identifier (`walletId`) that you'll use in all subsequent API calls. This is different from the blockchain address.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Address">
    The blockchain address is a hexadecimal string (e.g., `0x742d35...`) that works across all supported chains. Users can send funds directly to this address on any supported chain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User ID">
    The `userId` is a unique identifier in your application system. It allows you to map Pan wallets to users in your application. You can retrieve a wallet using either `walletId` or `userId`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Metadata">
    Optional key-value pairs for storing additional information about the wallet. Useful for storing user context, application-specific data, or tags.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Supported chains">
    List of all blockchains where this wallet can hold assets. Currently includes testnets; mainnet support coming soon.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Retrieving wallets

You can retrieve a wallet by `userId` or `walletId`:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# By user ID
curl -X GET https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets/user_123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"

# By wallet ID
curl -X GET https://api.pan.dev/v1/wallets/wallet_abc123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

```javascript JavaScript
// By user ID
const wallet = await getWalletByUserId('user_123');

// By wallet ID  
const wallet = await getWalletById('wallet_abc123');
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Wallets are isolated per developer account. You can only access wallets you've created, even if you know another developer's wallet ID.
</Note>

## Wallet limits

Subscription plans determine how many wallets you can create:

| Plan | Wallet Limit |
|------|--------------|
| Free | 100 wallets |
| Pro | 10,000 wallets |
| Enterprise | Unlimited |

If you reach your limit, you'll receive an error when attempting to create additional wallets:

<ResponseExample>
```json 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "WALLET_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
  "message": "You have reached your wallet limit of 100. Upgrade your plan to create more wallets.",
  "currentUsage": 100,
  "limit": 100
}
```
</ResponseExample>

## Wallet security

Pan handles all wallet security on your behalf:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="🔐 Encrypted storage" icon="lock">
    Private keys are stored using enterprise-grade encryption
  </Card>
  <Card title="🛡️ No key exposure" icon="shield">
    Private keys never leave our secure infrastructure
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ Automatic signing" icon="pen">
    All transactions are signed automatically and securely
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔍 Audit trail" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Complete transaction history for compliance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  Pan manages all private keys. You never need to handle, store, or interact with private keys directly. This eliminates the risk of key loss, theft, or accidental exposure.
</Warning>

## Multi-chain operations

Since Pan wallets support multiple chains, you can:

- **Hold assets on different chains**: A single wallet can have USDC on Ethereum, WETH on Base, and DAI on Arbitrum simultaneously
- **Query balances across chains**: Get all balances with a single API call
- **Execute cross-chain operations**: Use intents to move assets between chains automatically

## Best practices

<Tip>
  **Reuse wallets**: Create one wallet per user in your application and reuse it for all operations. Don't create a new wallet for each transaction.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Cache wallet info**: Wallet addresses and IDs rarely change. Cache this information locally to reduce API calls.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use metadata wisely**: Store useful context in wallet metadata, but avoid storing sensitive information like passwords or personal data.
</Tip>
