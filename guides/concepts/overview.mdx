Pan API is built around three fundamental concepts that work together to provide a powerful and intuitive interface for DeFi operations: **Wallets**, **Intents**, and **Execution Plans**.

## The Pan workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a wallet">
    Wallets are the foundation of Pan. Each wallet supports multiple blockchains with a single address, eliminating the need to manage separate addresses per chain.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check balances">
    Query balances across all chains and tokens with a single API call. Pan handles the complexity of querying multiple blockchains and formatting the results.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create an intent">
    Express what you want to achieve (e.g., "lend $1000 USDC") instead of specifying exact transactions. Pan's intelligent system handles the rest.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor execution">
    Track intent progress in real-time. Pan provides detailed status updates, execution plans, and comprehensive error reporting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data model

Pan uses a hierarchical data model:

```
Developer Account
  └── API Keys
  └── Wallets (many)
       └── Balance (per chain)
       └── Intents (many)
            └── Execution Plan
                 └── Transactions (many)
```

### Developers and API keys

Developers authenticate using API keys that identify their account. Each developer account has:
- Subscription plan (determines limits)
- Multiple API keys (for different environments)
- Multiple wallets (for different users in their application)

### Wallets

Wallets represent user accounts in your application. Each wallet:
- Has a unique identifier (`walletId`)
- Supports multiple blockchains with a single address
- Can execute multiple intents
- Maintains balances across all supported chains

### Intents

Intents represent high-level financial goals. When you create an intent, Pan:
1. Analyzes the current wallet state
2. Evaluates available DeFi protocols
3. Generates an optimized execution plan
4. Executes the plan automatically

### Execution plans

Execution plans are detailed strategies that describe how Pan will achieve an intent. They include:
- List of operations (swaps, bridges, deposits)
- Order of execution
- Expected costs and timing
- Alternative strategies if needed

## Example flow

Let's walk through a complete example:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create wallet">
    ```bash
    POST /v1/wallets
    {
      "userId": "alice_123",
      "metadata": {"email": "alice@example.com"}
    }
    ```
    
    Result: Wallet created with address `0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check balance">
    ```bash
    GET /v1/balances/wallet_abc123
    ```
    
    Result: Alice has 500 USDC on Ethereum Sepolia and 500 USDT on Base Sepolia
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create intent">
    ```bash
    POST /v1/intents
    {
      "walletId": "wallet_abc123",
      "action": "lend",
      "amount": "1000",
      "asset": "USDC",
      "chain": "ethereum-sepolia"
    }
    ```
    
    Pan's system analyzes and creates a plan:
    - Swap 500 USDT → USDC on Base Sepolia
    - Bridge 500 USDC from Base Sepolia → Ethereum Sepolia
    - Consolidate all USDC on Ethereum Sepolia
    - Deposit 1000 USDC into Aave lending protocol
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor execution">
    ```bash
    GET /v1/intents/intent_xyz789
    ```
    
    Track status: `pending` → `planning` → `executing` → `completed`
  </Step>
</Steps>
