## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.pan.dev/v1
```

<Note>
  **Staging environment**: For testing, use `https://api-staging.pan.dev/v1`. Staging uses testnet only and is isolated from production.
</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
  Keep your API key secret. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories. See our [authentication guide](/guides/authentication) for security best practices.
</Warning>

## API versioning

Pan API uses URL-based versioning. The current version is `v1`, included in the base URL. Future versions will use different URL paths (e.g., `/v2/`) to maintain backward compatibility.

## Request format

All requests should use:
- **Method**: HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)
- **Content-Type**: `application/json` for request bodies
- **Encoding**: UTF-8

## Response format

All responses return JSON with the following structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Success responses">
    Success responses (2xx status codes) return the requested resource or operation result directly:
    
    ```json
    {
      "id": "wallet_abc123",
      "userId": "user_123",
      "address": "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb",
      ...
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error responses">
    Error responses (4xx, 5xx status codes) return an error object:
    
    ```json
    {
      "error": "ERROR_CODE",
      "message": "Human-readable error message"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## HTTP status codes

Pan API uses standard HTTP status codes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="2xx Success" icon="check-circle">
    - **200**: OK - Request succeeded
    - **201**: Created - Resource created successfully
  </Card>
  <Card title="4xx Client errors" icon="exclamation-triangle">
    - **400**: Bad Request - Invalid request
    - **401**: Unauthorized - Missing/invalid API key
    - **403**: Forbidden - Resource limit exceeded
    - **404**: Not Found - Resource doesn't exist
    - **429**: Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded
  </Card>
  <Card title="5xx Server errors" icon="server">
    - **500**: Internal Server Error - Server error
    - **503**: Service Unavailable - Temporary outage
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

See [Error Handling](/guides/best-practices/error-handling) for detailed error codes and handling strategies.

## Rate limits

Rate limits are determined by your subscription plan:

| Plan | Requests per minute |
|------|---------------------|
| Free | 100 |
| Pro | 1,000 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

When rate limits are exceeded, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The response includes headers indicating when you can retry:

```
Retry-After: 60
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1642248000
```

## Pagination

Currently, all endpoints return complete results. Pagination will be added in future versions for endpoints that return large datasets.

## Webhooks

Webhooks for real-time notifications are coming soon. Until then, use polling to check intent status. See [Monitoring Status](/guides/monitoring-status) for best practices.
