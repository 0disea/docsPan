## What is Pan?

Pan is a comprehensive platform designed to simplify the integration of advanced digital asset management and DeFi operations into web and mobile applications. Our API abstracts away the inherent complexity of blockchain interactions, allowing developers to implement sophisticated decentralized finance features without deep knowledge of smart contracts, private key management, or transaction optimization.

## Key features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-chain wallet management">
    Create and manage wallets that work seamlessly across multiple blockchains. Each wallet gets a single address that's compatible with all supported chains, eliminating the need to manage separate addresses per blockchain.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Intent-based operations">
    Express high-level financial goals instead of specifying exact transactions. Pan automatically determines the best execution strategy, handling swaps, bridges, consolidation, and deposits as needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automatic execution planning">
    Our intelligent system analyzes wallet state, evaluates DeFi protocols, and generates optimized execution plans that minimize gas costs and slippage while maximizing efficiency.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Real-time status tracking">
    Monitor intent execution in real-time with detailed progress updates and comprehensive error reporting. Every operation is transparent and traceable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Get your API key from the dashboard and include it in all requests using the `Authorization` header.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create wallets">
    Create wallets for your users with a simple API call. Each wallet automatically supports all available blockchains.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check balances">
    Query balances across all chains and tokens with a single endpoint. Get real-time asset information including USD values.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Execute intents">
    Define what you want to achieve (like "lend $1000 USDC"), and Pan handles all the complexity of swaps, bridges, and deposits automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>
